# Flutter forms demo
This sample repository illustrates a relatively painless way to deal with forms, images and scrollable widgets simultaneously whilst attempting to move TextFormFields to a more comfortable position when the annoying Android keyboard gets in the way. 

It is kind of a hacky approach (notably, the height of your image needs to be adjusted - although it should always fit your device's width without stretching), but hopefully this should provide a decent foundation for a better one.

It works both in portrait and landscape.
